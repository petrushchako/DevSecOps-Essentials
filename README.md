You have been tasked with reviewing Docker Security for your team's host of servers. Clone the Docker Bench security script from Docker's official repo, then run the script against the provided server and save the output to /tmp/bench1.out. Review the script's findings, then solve one of the warnings (such as auditing the files in /var/lib/docker). Rerun the script, this time outputting the results to /tmp/bench2.out. Run a diff of the two files to see that your change has taken affect.

The Docker Bench Security repository can be found at:

https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git


Learning Objectives
1. Clone the Docker Bench repo from GitHub into the current working directory.
2. Change directory to the docker-bench-security directory and run the docker-bench-security script.
3. Update the audit rules on the server to include auditing the Docker Daemon
4. Run the Docker Bench security utility again and compare the output with the first run.
